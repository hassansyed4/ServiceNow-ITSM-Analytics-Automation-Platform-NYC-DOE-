# ServiceNow-ITSM-Analytics-Automation-Platform-NYC-DOE-
Designed and supported ServiceNow ITSM dashboards and automated KPI reporting to provide leadership with real-time visibility into incidents, SLAs, and service performance.

## Business Problem

Leadership did not have a clear view of IT service performance. Reports were created manually, took a lot of time, and were often outdated, making it difficult to track SLAs and service health.

## My Role

ServiceNow Senior Developer supporting ITSM reporting and automation initiatives.

## What I Built

I helped design ITSM dashboards that showed incident volumes, SLA compliance, and service trends. I also automated KPI reporting so leadership could see real-time service performance without manual effort.

## Tools Used

ServiceNow Reports

Performance Analytics

SLAs & SLA Schedules

Scheduled Jobs

Dashboards

## Challenges

Data was inconsistent across teams, and SLA definitions were not standardized, which made reporting unreliable.

## How I Solved It

I worked with teams to standardize SLA definitions and reporting logic, cleaned up report filters, and automated data refresh schedules.

## Outcome

Manual reporting effort was reduced by 60%, and leadership gained clear visibility into IT service health and performance.
